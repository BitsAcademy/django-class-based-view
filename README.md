### Django Class Based view Complete Overview 
**Class-based views** are favorite feature of [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/),The key principles of class based view are organized and beautiful code design: donâ€™t repeat yourself (stay **DRY**).
Whenever we see a class-based view inside a urls.py url definition, you will usually see MyView.as_view().  as_view does all the heavy lifting of converting your Class into a callable that the url system understands.  
TemplateView is a mixture of View and two mixins: TemplateResponseMixin and ContextMixin.
ContextMixin is pretty straightforward. ContextMixin defines single method get_context_data. This returns a dictionary. It is important to become familiar with get_context_data as it is one of the methods we most frequently override. A common thing to remember when overriding this method is to not forget to make the __super__ call to collect all this context.

#There are some great sources of information about class-based views. 
[Django Official Document](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/class-based-views/)
[Effective Django tutolrial](http://www.effectivedjango.com/classbasedviews.html)
Additionally, I find [ccbv.co.uk](http://ccbv.co.uk/) to be an invaluable resource.  It provides a flattened perspective of all of the default view types.  It is a great tool for learning how different mixins and views work together to form the complex views used in many applications.
